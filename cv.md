### ABOUT ME

My actual vocation concerns foreign languages and literature, literary criticism and writing. It was at some point in time when I understood that I would like to create my own website, my personal paradise, where I could post my papers, stories, impressions, and frustrations (if any). That is how I started learning Web Development. Subsequently this travel route led me to `JS/Front-end course in RS school`  and I would like to futher develop in this direction.
